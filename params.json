BMC Bioinformatics, 2017.\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n\r\n* All codes are tested using MATLAB R2013a.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Datasets\r\n\r\n* P_G_NoSN_PPICenter.mat: the NoSN with tissue-specific PPI networks as the center networks.\r\n* P_G_NoSN_GCNCenter.mat: the NoSN with either tissue-specific gene co-expression networks or tissue-specific PPI networks as the center networks.\r\n* P_G_NoSN_PPICenter_2GCNs.mat: the NoSN with tissue-specific PPI networks as the center networks, and two sets of tissue-specific gene co-expression networks as the auxiliary networks.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n* PhenotypeSimNet: the disease similarity network.\r\n* PhenotypeID: the MIM IDs of diseases in the disease similarity network.\r\n* TSGeneNets: the tissue-specific molecular networks corresponding to the diseases in the disease similarity network. Each disease corresponds to at least one tissue-specific molecular network.\r\n* TSGeneNetsID: the corresponding Entrez IDs of genes in TSGeneNets.\r\n* AllGeneID: the Entrez IDs of all genes in all tissue-specific molecular networks.\r\n* Seeds: the known causal genes of diseases in each tissue-specific molecular network, corresponding to TSGeneNets.\r\n* TissueDict: the dictionary of the names of the most associated tissues of the diseases in the disease similarity network.\r\n\r\n# Algorithm CR\r\n\r\n* CR_CrossValidation.m: leave-one-out cross validation of CR.\r\n* CR_Precomputation.m: the precomputation step of CR.\r\n* CR: CR power method.\r\n* J_CR.m: the objective function value of CrossRank.\r\n* AUCEvaluation.m and AUCValue.m: AUC value evaluation with up to 50, 100, 300, 500, 700 and 1000 false positives.\r\n\r\nRun CR_CrossValidation.m to see the evaluation results of the leave-one-out cross validation of CR algorithm. CR only uses the center networks in the NoSN datasets.\r\n\r\n# Algorithm CRstar\r\n\r\n* CRstar_CrossValidation.m: leave-one-out cross validation of CRstar.\r\n* CRstar_Precomputation.m: the precomputation step of CRstar.\r\n* CRstar: CRstar power method.\r\n* J_CRstar.m: the objective function value of CrossRankStar.\r\n* AUCEvaluation.m and AUCValue.m: AUC value evaluation with up to 50, 100, 300, 500, 700 and 1000 false positives.\r\n\r\nRun CRstar_CrossValidation.m to see the evaluation results of the leave-one-out cross validation of CRstar algorithm.\r\n\r\n# Algorithm WCRstar\r\n\r\n* WCRstar_CrossValidation.m: leave-one-out cross validation of WCRstar.\r\n* WCRstar_Precomputation.m: the precomputation step of WCRstar.\r\n* WCRstar: WCRstar alternating minimization approach.\r\n* J_WCRstar.m: the objective function value of Weighted CrossRankStar.\r\n* J_aux.m: the center-auxiliary network inconsistency value of Weighted CrossRankStar.\r\n* AUCEvaluation.m and AUCValue.m: AUC value evaluation with up to 50, 100, 300, 500, 700 and 1000 false positives.\r\n\r\nRun WCRstar_CrossValidation.m to see the evaluation results of the leave-one-out cross validation of WCRstar algorithm. WCRstar uses P_G_NoSN_PPICenter_2GCNs.mat dataset as default.\r\n\r\n# Note\r\n\r\n* CR, CRstar and WCRstar have precomputation steps, which may take some time. The precomputation steps only need to be computed once for a dataset. If a precomputation file exists for a dataset, CR, CRstar and WCRstar will detect it and start ranking directly.",
